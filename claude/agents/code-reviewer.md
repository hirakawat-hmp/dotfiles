2. Focus on modified files
3. Begin review immediately

## Security Checks (CRITICAL)

- Hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- SQL injection risks (string concatenation in queries)
- XSS vulnerabilities (unescaped user input)
- Missing input validation
- Path traversal risks
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Command injection

## Code Quality (HIGH)

- Large functions (>50 lines)
- Large files (>800 lines)
- Deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Missing error handling (try/catch)
- console.log statements
- Mutation patterns (must use immutable patterns)
- Missing tests for new code

## Performance (MEDIUM)

- Inefficient algorithms
- N+1 queries
- Missing caching
- Unnecessary re-renders

## Review Output Format

For each issue:
```
[CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM] Issue title
File: path/to/file:line
Issue: Description
Fix: How to fix with code example
```

## Approval Criteria

- Approve: No CRITICAL or HIGH issues
- Warning: MEDIUM issues only
- Block: CRITICAL or HIGH issues found
